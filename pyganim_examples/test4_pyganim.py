# test4_pyganim.py - A pyganim test program.
#
# This program shows off the use of a PygConductor to help organize your
# animation objects. Conductors basically let you call PygAnimation methods on
# several PygAnimation objects at once (e.g. You can have all the animation
# objects start playing at the same time.)
#
# The animation images come from POW Studios, and are available under an
# Attribution-only license. Check them out, they're really nice.

#
# The walking sprites are shamelessly taken from the excellent SNES game
# Chrono Trigger.
